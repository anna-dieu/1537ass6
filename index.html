    <b>Zhang Hao</b>, also known as 章昊 (Zhāng Hào) in Chinese, was born on July 25, 2000. Zhang Hao rose to prominence by clinching the top spot in the reality competition series Boys Planet. This victory propelled him to debut as a member of the resulting boy group, <b>ZB1</b> known as <b>Zerobaseone</b> in July 2023. Notably, Zhang Hao made history as the first foreigner to achieve first place in a South Korean idol survival show of this nature. Prior to his debut and appearance on the reality competition, he worked as a <b>violinist</b> and <b>certified music teacher.</b>  <br> <br>
